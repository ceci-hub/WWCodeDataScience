## STATISTICS IN DATA SCIENCE

A 7-part series that starts with the basics to statistics to advanced statistics in all machine learning algorithms. The topics are as follow:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data and Sampling Distribution 
3. Statistical Experiments 
4. Regression and Predictions 
5. Statistics in Classification 
6. Statistical Machine Learning 
7. Statistics in Unsupervised Learning
